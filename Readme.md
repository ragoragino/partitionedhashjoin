- Boost, GoogleTest, Google Benchmark, XXHash and Mimalloc 

Work in progress

TODO (4.7.):
- continue with Radix Clustering algorithm implementation
- write unit tests (e.g. ThreadPool)
- add some benchmarks
- investigate why is SeparateChaining significantly slower than LinearProbing
- make HashJoin algorithms parametrized
